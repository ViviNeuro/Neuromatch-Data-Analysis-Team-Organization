# Enrolment  

Staff members will clean the **Enrolment and Post-Course data** after the course, as these analyses may involve sensitive participant information.

If you need access to the pipeline, please ask in the '#a-25-evaluation' channel.

The cleaned datasets for Enrolment and Post-Course data are available in the *"Cleaned Dataset"* folder within each year's directory.
