# Collaboration Guidelines  

To ensure everyone works efficiently and collaboratively, please follow these guidelines:

---

### 1. Choose a Task  
- Tasks are divided among volunteers and staff, with several **standard topics** available.  
- A table with tasks and deadlines will be provided.  
- Review the list and choose a task that aligns with your interests and expertise.  

Once you’ve decided on a task:  
- Notify **Viviana Greco** of your selection.  
- If a task you’re interested in has already been chosen, reach out to the person working on it to discuss:  
   - **Splitting the work** or  
   - **Collaborating** on different parts.  

Collaboration is encouraged, but please clearly define roles to **avoid duplication of effort**.

### 2. Review Task Requirements  
- If you are unsure about your expertise or role, review the **main questions** that need to be answered for each task.  [ADD LINK]
This will help clarify the task’s goals and your potential contribution.

### 3. Label Your Work  
- If you’re working within an **existing notebook**, clearly label the section you are contributing to with your name.  
   For example, if analyzing **student surveys** under the "Experience" section:

   ```markdown
   ## Experience Analysis - Viviana
   ```
- If you create a new notebook, save it in the corresponding year folder and use a clear, descriptive name.
For example:
`attendance_analysis_2024_viviana.ipynb`

### 4. Communicate Effectively
Use the `#a-24-evaluation` Slack channel as the main communication platform.
If you encounter any roadblocks, need clarification, or require assistance ask your questions directly in the Slack channel!

Collaboration and quick communication will ensure smoother progress for everyone.
