# Students Daily Surveys: Key Analysis Questions


Welcome to the Student Daily Surveys Key Questions page!

Before you begin any analyses, please ensure that your data is properly cleaned. 

This section is intended to guide data analysts through the key questions that explore studentsâ€™ experiences during the course. By investigating these questions, we aim to uncover valuable insights regarding survey participation, social dynamics, TA interactions, and content engagement. Use these points as a framework to maintain consistency and depth in your analysis.

Once your analyses are complete, please create a PowerPoint presentation to summarize your findings. For reference, you may consult an example presentation here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1egp0GtndITjjlA_2gRbyjYWbCf23cv81sgXPpfcB-ZI/edit#slide=id.g31966fbc7bc_0_432

## Survey Completion Rate (General Overview)

**What percentage of students, on average, completed the daily surveys?**
Calculate the daily percentage of survey completion rates across all course days. Ensure this is calculated based on the `number of certified students`.

Suggested Visualization:
- A bar plot with:
    - X-axis: Days (e.g., w1d1, w1d2, etc.).
    - Y-axis: Survey completion percentage.
    - Annotated data labels for each bar showing exact percentages.

## Pod Social Experience (General Overview)

**How did students rate their social experience in their pods?**
Analyze the overall distribution of ratings without grouping by pod to gain a broad understanding of students' social experiences.

Suggested Visualization:
- A box plot with:
    - X-axis: Days.
    - Y-axis: Social experience ratings.

**What is the average pod experience score, and how does it differ across days?** Calculate the daily average score for all students and overlay a line plot on the boxplot to identify overall trends in pod experience ratings. **Is there a trend in pod experience ratings as the course progresses? Do you see an upward or downward trend over the course duration?**

### TA Communication (General Overview)

**Were students comfortable communicating with their TAs?**
Analyze the overall distribution of ratings without grouping by pod.

Suggested Visualization:
- A box plot with:
    - X-axis: Days.
    - Y-axis: TA communication ratings.

**Does the rating of TA communication improve or decline throughout the course?** Examine daily averages to identify trends in student perceptions.

### Daily Content Questions (Performance Overview)

**What is the percentage of correct and incorrect answers for each daily content-related question?** Are there specific questions where students particularly struggled?

Suggested Visualization:
- A stacked bar plot with:
    - X-axis: Days.
    - Y-axis: percentage of correct and incorrect answers.

### Cross Analysis: Content Scores, Pod Experience, and TA Communication

**Is there a correlation between low pod experience ratings and lower content-related scores?** Investigate whether social dynamics impact performance.

**Does poor TA communication explain lower content-related scores?**
Explore the relationship between TA communication ratings and performance.

**Does a combination of low pod experience and poor TA communication explain lower performance on content-related questions?**
Analyze combined effects to identify trends in performance.

### Tutorial Progress (General Overview)

**How far did students get in the daily tutorials by the end of each day?** Analyze students' progress through the daily tutorials to identify how many reached the final sections and the distribution of progress across sections for each day.

1. Calculate the percentage of students who reached the last section of the tutorial for each day.
2. For each day, calculate the percentage of students who completed each section of the tutorial.
Suggested Visualization:
- A bar plot for each day with:
    - X-axis: Tutorial sections (e.g., Section 1, Section 2, etc.).
    - Y-axis: Percentage of students who completed that section.
