    - Y-axis: Survey completion percentage.
    - Annotated data labels for each bar showing exact percentages.

## Overall Experience (General Overview)

**How did TAs rate their overall experience working with their pods?**
Analyze the overall distribution of ratings to gain a broad understanding of TAs experiences. Please also group by TA role (Regular, Project, Lead).

Suggested Visualization:
- A box plot with:
    - X-axis: Days.
    - Y-axis: Experience ratings.

- What is the average experience score, and how does it differ across days? Calculate the daily average score for all TAs and overlay a line plot on the boxplot to identify overall trends in experience ratings. 
- Is there a trend in TAs experience ratings as the course progresses? Do you see an upward or downward trend over the course duration?
- If they had a bad experience, what is the reason for it?
