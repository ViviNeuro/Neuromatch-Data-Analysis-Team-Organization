# Welcome to the Data Analysis Team!

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Data Analysis Team for Neuromatch and Climatematch! We're excited to have you on board.

Our goal is to **standardize the analysis process** to ensure that everyone works with clean, consistently preprocessed data. This not only streamlines our workflows but also helps maintain **accuracy and reproducibility** in our analyses.

Before diving into any code, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with the guidelines and resources outlined on these pages. They will provide you with the **necessary framework** to get started and avoid common pitfalls.

If you encounter anything unclear or need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out! Our team is here to support you. Join us on Slack in the `#a-24-evaluation` channel, where you can ask questions and collaborate with others.

Let’s make data analysis at Neuromatch and Climatematch as smooth and effective as possible. 

Happy analyzing!
