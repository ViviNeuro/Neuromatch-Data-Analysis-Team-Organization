# Understanding the Datasets

To ensure clarity when working with the datasets, we have created **[Data Descriptors](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u-aG6doOucNUQoFnGyYiuocXddJtc_23)**. These spreadsheets provide detailed explanations of the variables and their meanings, helping you understand what each column represents. This includes the **type of data** (e.g., free text, single select, multiple choice) and the context of each variable.

### **What’s Included in the Data Descriptors**:

| **Field**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Variable Name**     | The name of the column in the dataset.                                        |
| **Variable Type**     | The type of data contained in the column (e.g., free text, single select).    |
| **Variable Description** | The specific question asked in the survey.                                  |
| **Values**            | The possible answers or options corresponding to each question.               |
